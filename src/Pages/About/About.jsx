        <br />
        The Dragon News was founded in 1994 by a group of passionate journalists
        and media professionals who believed in the power of the press to inform
        and inspire. In an era before the internet became ubiquitous, our
        founders envisioned a newspaper that would bridge the gap between local
        news and global events, bringing a balanced perspective to the readers.
        The first issue was a modest eight-page paper, but it laid the
        foundation for what would become a distinguished publication.

        changes by launching our online edition in the early 2000s, expanding
        our reach and allowing us to provide real-time updates to our readers.
        Our website now features multimedia content, including videos, podcasts,
        and interactive infographics, catering to the diverse preferences of
        modern audiences. ####
